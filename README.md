# Multi-label Cardiac Abnormality Classification from Electrocardiogram using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks - Physionet/CinC Challenge 2021

## What's in this repository?

This repository contains the code submitted to the Physionet/CinC Challenge 2021 by the team NIMA. You can try it by running the following commands on any of the Challenge training sets. We have implemented a deep neural network architecture to perform multi-label classification of 26 cardiac abnormalities from 12-lead, and reduced lead ECG data.

We would appreciate a citation to our paper, doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ac73d5 (PDF conference paper: https://www.cinc.org/archives/2021/pdf/CinC2021-352.pdf), if you use our work in your research.

This repository was cloned from the Example python classifier provided by the organizers for the challenge and then edited. Link: https://github.com/physionetchallenges/python-classifier-2021. The main code can be found in team_code.py. Go to the above link to find how the code can be run.

**However, I have now added a colab notebook in this repo which can be easily run, accessed and be understood. Cheers!**
